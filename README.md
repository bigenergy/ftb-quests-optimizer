# FTB Quests Optimizer

A simple mod that installs on the server and contains a couple of mixins.

There is an optimization problem in FTB Quests; if you have a lot of quests on the server and a lot of players, your server will have a very low tick rate.
I tried for a long time to figure out what the problem was and wrote this mod, it tries to fix the situation with the poor performance of ftb quests.

Currently, the mod is intended only for Forge & Fabric and does not require installation on the client, just install it on the server.

If you want better performance, install my second mod, both mods will practically eliminate the lag problems associated with achievements and quests.

Feel free to write about all problems and suggestions on my github! Good luck!
